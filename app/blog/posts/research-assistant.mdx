An experience that opened my eyes towards the beauty in contributing to the scientific society. As a student, I go the best teacher, as a mentee I got amazing mentors (**Dr. Vinod** Sir & **Dr. Radhamani** Mam)
## A Simple Abstract

We are proposing a novel
multimodal fusion algorithm, leveraging three different visual malware features: Grayscale Image, Entropy Graph, and
SimHash Image, with which we conducted exhaustive experiments independently on each feature and combinations of all
three of them using fusion operators such as average, maximum, add, and concatenate for effective malware detection and
classification. The proposed strategy has a detection rate 1.00 (on a scale of 0â€“1) in identifying malware in the given
dataset. We explained its interpretability with visualization techniques such as t-SNE, SHAP, and Grad-CAM. Experi-
mental results show the model works even for a highly imbalanced dataset. We also assessed the effectiveness of the
proposed method on obfuscated malware and achieved state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we performed adversarial
attacks on the proposed model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and employed adversarial retraining as a
defense strategy. This strategy enhances model robustness, allowing it to withstand GAN-based attacks with an F1-score of
0.998 for the BIG2015 dataset and 1.0 for the Malhub dataset. The proposed methodology is more reliable as our findings
prove that the VGG16 model can detect and classify malware in real time.
