summary: 'In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the debate between dynamic and static typing continues to be a hot topic.'

A 7 week fellowship where I got to work on several AI integrated Software which helped me grow as an AI SWE.

## Stacks 
Python, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI & Gemini API, Clerk, Stripe

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

// This will throw an error at compile time, preventing potential runtime issues.
let message: string = greet(123)
```

## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

Static typing makes code more readable and maintainable. By explicitly declaring types, developers provide a clear contract of what the code does, making it easier for others (or themselves in the future) to understand and modify the codebase.

## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

Modern IDEs leverage static typing to offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. These tools can automatically detect issues, suggest fixes, and safely refactor code, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

```csharp
// Refactoring example: Renaming a method in C#
public class Calculator {
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// After refactoring `Add` to `Sum`, all references are automatically updated.
public class Calculator {
    public int Sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Static typing can lead to better performance. Since types are known at compile time, compilers can optimize the generated code more effectively. This can result in faster execution times and lower resource consumption.

## Conclusion

Static typing offers numerous benefits that contribute to the development of robust, efficient, and maintainable software. By catching errors early, enhancing readability, facilitating tooling, and enabling optimizations, static typing is an invaluable asset for developers. As the software industry continues to mature, the importance of static typing in ensuring code quality and performance cannot be overstated. Whether you're working on a large-scale enterprise application or a small project, embracing static typing can lead to better software development outcomes.
